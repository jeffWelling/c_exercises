Once upon a time in never-never-land there was a small boy named Peter Pan who was eaten by a crocodile. It was painful and there was screaming, and the screaming drew a group of 'lost boys' to the scene of the incident where they discovered what was left of the once-famous Peter Pan. The End. Eat your heart out Disney.
